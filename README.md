# Standard
Beautiful, minimalistic typing tests

**NOTICE**: We were given express permission by YK to fix a major authentication bug that did not appear until after development had finished. This is why the repl has been updated after the deadline!
**Other Edit**: We got consistently spammed by some jerks so some updates had to be made for the server. This includes a new setinterval system, and a new way of fetching graphql urls to reduce load on replit's end too.
